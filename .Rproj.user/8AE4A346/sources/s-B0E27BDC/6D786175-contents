<h3>HER Story Map</h3>
<p>The purpose of HER Story Map is to show spatial accessibility of women veterans to Women's Health providers based on traditional spatial accessibility model and then through a modified model which incorporates patient reviews. The purpose of HER Story Map is to expose the results of my research to a broad audience, with an emphasis on women veteran stakeholders.</p>
