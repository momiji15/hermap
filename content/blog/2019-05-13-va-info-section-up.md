While HER Map currently covers only gender-specific care with mostly non-VA providers, it is important to have information about the quality of VA health facillities as well. This lead to the creation of a [VA information](https://hermap.netlify.com/docs/vainfo/) section on the HER Map landing page in which you can look at information about the quality of VA Health facilities by Veterans Integrated Service Network and for each facility. Currently, such information is not available in HER Map, but if there is enough interest, an app can be deployed that contains this type of information. Unfortunately, there is no known open data on women's health providers in the VA system, so the information in this section does not include this information. However, there is some information about a few women's health providers at the VA or at a military health clinic on HER Map: San Antonio.
