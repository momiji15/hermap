bref = "It all started in spring 2015 with a Saturday meet-up with a friend and co-worker. At that time I worked for the government and planned on going back to school. I told my friend about my plan to leave work and go back to school and we talked about possible research topics. My friend, a woman veteran, told me that it would be worthwhile to look into women veteran issues because it was understudied and told me about her difficulty finding the health resources she needed after she left the military. Once I started  school, I realized that there were little to no known studies of women veterans in the discipline of geography.  At that point, the idea of HER Map was born"

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Currently, HER Map is comprised of three components; <a href = "https://bit.ly/2TKAtzD">HER Map: San Antonio</a>, <a href = "https://bit.ly/2Y7biWt">HER Map: Women Veteran Groups and Advocates</a>, and <a href = "https://usg.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=289ad580efec4a9d86e3aefef1ebcdea">HER Story Map</a>.  HER Maps are currently in prototype stage and are available online. There will be a mobile app version of HER Map coming soon which will be available in both the Google Play store and the Apple app store.</p>

<p>The goal of HER Map is to have nationwide coverage of health and educational resources that are relevant to women veterans. If you are a women veteran stakeholder or organization that is interested in having a HER Map for your area, please don't hesistate to <a href = "mailto:das55839@uga.edu">contact me</a>.</p>

<h3>HER Map: San Antonio </h3>
<p>HER Map is a compilation of health and educational resources that is relevant for women veterans in San Antonio. This app contains information about Women's Health providers. This app also has information about non-profits and educational programs that could be useful for women veterans. Not all non-profits are women veteran specific, but could be useful to women veterans.</p>

<h3>HER Map: Women Veteran Groups and Advocates </h3>
<p>HER Map: Women Veteran Groups and Advocates is a nationwide map of women veteran groups and individuals dedicated to serving the needs of women veterans. In addition, there is a listing of state women veteran coordinators. Not all states have women veteran coordinators, so the director of veterans' affairs have been listed for these states.</p>

<h3>HER Story Map</h3>
<p>The purpose of HER Story Map is to show spatial accessibility of women veterans to Women's Health providers based on traditional spatial accessibility model and then through a modified model which incorporates patient reviews. The purpose of HER Story Map is to expose the results of my research to a broad audience, with an emphasis on women veteran stakeholders.</p>
