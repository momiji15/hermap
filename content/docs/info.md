<h2>Sources</h2>
<h3>HER Map: San Antonio </h3>
<p>This app contains information about Women's Health providers. Data about the providers were collected on the Texas Medical Board website, Humana TRICARE site, and on the sites of the individual providers and clinics. The combined internet rating was based on taking a weighted average from the star ratings off of Google, ZocDoc, HealthGrades, Vitals, and WebMD. This app also has information about non-profits and educational programs that could be useful for women veterans. Not all non-profits are women veteran specific, but could be useful to women veterans. This information was gathered through texvet.com and through an internet query about women veteran specific organizations.</p>

<h3>HER Map: Women Veteran Groups and Advocates</h3>
Information about the state coordinators was collected from the National Association of State Women Veteran Coordinators, The Women's Memorial, and Women Vets USA along with a general inquiry on these resources.
